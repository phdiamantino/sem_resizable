mailtobrucecallenishcom>bruce atherton<a> class for scanning a directory for filesdirectories which match certain criterion these criterion consist of selector and pattern which have been specified with the selector you can select which file you want to have included file which are not selected are excluded with pattern you can include or exclude file based on their filename the idea is simple a given directory is recursively scanned for all file and directory each filedirectory is matched against a set of selector including special support for matching against filename with include and and exclude pattern only filesdirectories which match at least one pattern of the include pattern list or other file selector and don't match any pattern of the exclude pattern list or fail to match against a required selector will be placed in the list of filesdirectories found when no list of include pattern is supplied will be used which mean that everything will be matched when no list of exclude pattern is supplied an empty list is used such that nothing will be excluded when no selector are supplied none are applied the filename pattern matching is done a follows the name to be matched is split up in path segment a path segment is the name of a directory or file which is bounded by fileseparator '' under unix '' under window for example abcdefghixyzjava is split up in the segment abc defghi and xyzjava the same is done for the pattern against which should be matched the segment of the name and the pattern are then matched against each other when '' is used for a path segment in the pattern it match zero or more path segment of the name there is a special case regarding the use of fileseparator s at the beginning of the pattern and the string to match when a pattern start with a fileseparator the string to match must also start with a fileseparator when a pattern doe not start with a fileseparator the string to match may not start with a fileseparator when one of these rule is not obeyed the string will not match when a name path segment is matched against a pattern path segment the following special character can be used '' match zero or more character '?' match one character example class match all class filesdirs in a directory tree testa??java match all filesdirs which start with an 'a' then two more character and then java in a directory called test match everything in a directory tree testxyz match all filesdirs which start with xyz and where there is a parent directory called test eg abctestdefghixyz123 case sensitivity

been specified with the selector you can select which file you want to have included file which are not selected are excluded with pattern you can include or exclude file based on their filename the idea is simple a given directory is recursively scanned for all file and directory each filedirectory is matched against a set of selector including special support for matching against filename with include and and exclude pattern only filesdirectories which match at least one pattern of the include pattern list or other file selector and don't match any pattern of the exclude pattern list or fail to match against a required selector will be placed in the list of filesdirectories found when no list of include pattern is supplied will be used which mean that everything will be matched when no list of exclude pattern is supplied an empty list is used such that nothing will be excluded when no selector are supplied none are applied the filename pattern matching is done a follows the name to be matched is split up in path segment a path segment is the name of a directory or file which is bounded by fileseparator '' under unix '' under window for example abcdefghixyzjava is split up in the segment abc defghi and xyzjava the same is done for the pattern against which should be matched the segment of the name and the pattern are then matched against each other when '' is used for a path segment in the pattern it match zero or more path segment of the name there is a special case regarding the use of fileseparator s at the beginning of the pattern and the string to match when a pattern start with a fileseparator the string to match must also start with a fileseparator when a pattern doe not start with a fileseparator the string to match may not start with a fileseparator when one of these rule is not obeyed the string will not match when a name path segment is matched against a pattern path segment the following special character can be used '' match zero or more character '?' match one character example class match all class filesdirs in a directory tree testa??java match all filesdirs which start with an 'a' then two more character and then java in a

setting values three interfaces using orgapachetoolsantintrospectionhelper therefore special 'configuration interfaces' implemented new caches algorithms comparators present set xx methods used eg digestalgorithm use specified provider computing value selecting setprovider string providername method use nested <param name algorithmprovider value myprovider> author jan matu00e8rne version 20030913 since ant 16 selector class that us algorithm cache and comparator for it work the algorithm is used for computing a hashvalue for a file the comparator decides whether to select or not the cache store the other value for comparison by the comparator in a persistent manner the modifiedselector is implemented a a <b>coreselector<b> and us default value for all it attribute therefore the simpliest example is <copy todir dest> <filelist dir src> <modified> <filelist> <copy> the same example rewritten a coreselector with setting the all value same a default are would be <copy todir dest> <filelist dir src> <modified update true cache propertyfile algorithm digest comparator equal> <param name cachecachefile value cacheproperties> <param name algorithmalgorithm value md5> <modified> <filelist> <copy> and the same rewritten a customselector would be <copy todir dest> <filelist dir src> <custom class orgapachetoolsanttypeselectorsmodifiedselector> <param name update value true> <param name cache value propertyfile> <param name algorithm value digest> <param name comparator value equal> <param name cachecachefile value cacheproperties> <param name algorithmalgorithm value md5> <custom> <filelist> <copy> all these three example copy the file from src to dest using the modifiedselector the modifiedselector us the propertyfilecache the digestalgorithm and the equalcomparator for it work the propertyfilecache store keyvaluepairs in a simple java property file the filename is cacheproperties the update flag let the selector update the value in the cache and on first call creates the cache the digestalgorithm computes a hashvalue using the javasecuritymessagedigest class with it md5algorithm and it standard provider the new computed hashvalue and the stored one are compared by the equalcomparator which return 'true' more correct a value not equal zero 1 if the value are not the same using simple string comparison a useful scenario for this selector is inside a build environment for homepage generation eg with <a href httpxmlapacheorgforrest> apache forrest<a> <target name generateanduploadsite> <echo> generate the site

subdirectories directory called modules class for scanning a directory for filesdirectories which match certain criterion these criterion consist of selector and pattern which have been specified with the selector you can select which file you want to have included file which are not selected are excluded with pattern you can include or exclude file based on their filename the idea is simple a given directory is recursively scanned for all file and directory each filedirectory is matched against a set of selector including special support for matching against filename with include and and exclude pattern only filesdirectories which match at least one pattern of the include pattern list or other file selector and don't match any pattern of the exclude pattern list or fail to match against a required selector will be placed in the list of filesdirectories found when no list of include pattern is supplied will be used which mean that everything will be matched when no list of exclude pattern is supplied an empty list is used such that nothing will be excluded when no selector are supplied none are applied the filename pattern matching is done a follows the name to be matched is split up in path segment a path segment is the name of a directory or file which is bounded by fileseparator '' under unix '' under window for example abcdefghixyzjava is split up in the segment abc defghi and xyzjava the same is done for the pattern against which should be matched the segment of the name and the pattern are then matched against each other when '' is used for a path segment in the pattern it match zero or more path segment of the name there is a special case regarding the use of fileseparator s at the beginning of the pattern and the string to match when a pattern start with a fileseparator the string to match must also start with a fileseparator when a pattern doe not start with a fileseparator the string to match may not start with a fileseparator when one of these rule is not obeyed the string will not match when a name path segment is matched against a pattern path segment the following special character can be used '' match zero or more character '?' match one character example class match all class filesdirs in a directory tree testa??java match all filesdirs which start with an 'a' then two more character and then java in a directory called test match everything in a directory tree testxyz match all filesdirs which start with xyz and where there is a parent directory called test eg abctestdefghixyz123 case sensitivity

property file the filename is cacheproperties the update flag let the selector update the value in the cache and on first call creates the cache the digestalgorithm computes a hashvalue using the javasecuritymessagedigest class with it md5algorithm and it standard provider the new computed hashvalue and the stored one are compared by the equalcomparator which return 'true' more correct a value not equal zero 1 if the value are not the same using simple string comparison a useful scenario for this selector is inside a build environment for homepage generation eg with <a href

three interface using orgapachetoolsantintrospectionhelper therefore no special 'configuration interfaces' ha to be implemented by new cache algorithm or comparators all present set xx method can be

javasecuritymessagedigest class with it md5algorithm and it standard provider the new computed hashvalue and the stored one are compared by the equalcomparator which return 'true' more correct a value not equal zero 1 if the value are not the same using simple string comparison a useful scenario for this selector is inside a build environment for homepage generation eg with <a href

subdirectories directory called modules class for scanning a directory for filesdirectories which match certain criterion these criterion consist of selector and pattern which have been specified with the selector you can select which file you want to have included file which are not selected are excluded with pattern you can include or exclude file based on their filename the idea is simple a given directory is recursively scanned for all file and directory each filedirectory is matched against a set of selector including special support for matching against filename with include and and exclude pattern only filesdirectories which match at least one pattern of the include pattern list or other file selector and don't match any pattern of the exclude pattern list or fail to match against a required selector will be placed in the list of filesdirectories found when no list of include pattern is supplied will be used which mean that everything will be matched when no list of exclude pattern is supplied an empty list is used such that nothing will be excluded when no selector are supplied none are applied the filename pattern matching is done a follows the name to be matched is split up in path segment a path segment is the name of a directory or file which is bounded by fileseparator '' under unix '' under window for example abcdefghixyzjava is split up in the segment abc defghi and xyzjava the same is done for the pattern against which should be matched the segment of the name and the pattern are then matched against each other when '' is used for a path segment in the pattern it match zero or more path segment of the name there is a special case regarding the use of fileseparator s at the beginning of the pattern and the string to match when a pattern start with a fileseparator the string to match must also start with a fileseparator when a pattern doe not start with a fileseparator the string to match may not start with a fileseparator when one of these rule is not obeyed the string will not match when a name path segment is matched against a pattern path segment the following special character can be used '' match zero or more character '?' match one character example class match all class filesdirs in a directory tree testa??java match all filesdirs which start with an 'a' then two more character and then java in a

subdirectories directory called modules class for scanning a directory for filesdirectories which match certain criterion these criterion consist of selector and pattern which have been specified with the selector you can select which file you want to have included file which are not selected are excluded with pattern you can include or exclude file based on their filename the idea is simple a given directory is recursively scanned for all file and directory each filedirectory is matched against a set of selector including special support for matching against filename with include and and exclude pattern only filesdirectories which match at least one pattern of the include pattern list or other file selector and don't match any pattern of the exclude pattern list or fail to match against a required selector will be placed in the list of filesdirectories found when no list of include pattern is supplied will be used which mean that everything will be matched when no list of exclude pattern is supplied an empty list is used such that nothing will be excluded when no selector are supplied none are applied the filename pattern matching is done a follows the name to be matched is split up in path segment a path segment is the name of a directory or file which is bounded by fileseparator '' under unix '' under window for example abcdefghixyzjava is split up in the segment abc defghi and xyzjava the same is done for the pattern against which should be matched the segment of the name and the pattern are then matched against each other when '' is used for a path segment in the pattern it match zero or more path segment of the name there is a special case regarding the use of fileseparator s at the beginning of the pattern and the string to match when a pattern start with a fileseparator the string to match must also start with a fileseparator when a pattern doe not start with a fileseparator the string to match may not start with a fileseparator when one of these rule is not obeyed the string will not match when a name path segment is matched against a pattern path segment the following special character can be used '' match zero or more character '?' match one character example class match all class filesdirs in a directory tree testa??java match all filesdirs which start with an 'a' then two more character and then java in a

since ant 16 selector class that us algorithm cache and comparator for it work the algorithm is used for computing a hashvalue for a file the comparator decides whether to select or not the cache store the other value for comparison by the comparator in a persistent manner the modifiedselector is implemented a a <b>coreselector<b> and us default value for all it attribute therefore the simplest example is &ampltcopy todir dest&ampgt &ampltfilelist dir src&ampgt &ampltmodified&ampgt &ampltfilelist&ampgt &ampltcopy&ampgt the same example rewritten a coreselector with setting the all

algorithmalgorithm value md5&ampgt &ampltcustom&ampgt &ampltfilelist&ampgt &ampltcopy&ampgt if you want to provide your own interface implementation you can do that via the classname attribute if the class are not on ant's core classpath you will have to provide the path via nested &ampltclasspath&ampgt element so that the selector can find the class &ampltmodified cacheclassname commycompanymycache&ampgt &ampltclasspath&ampgt &ampltpathelement location libmycompanyantutiljar&ampgt &ampltclasspath&ampgt &ampltmodified&ampgt all these three example copy the file from src to dest using the modifiedselector the modifiedselector us the propertyfilecache the digestalgorithm and the equalcomparator for it work the propertyfilecache store keyvaluepairs in a simple java property file the filename is cacheproperties the update flag let the selector update the value in the cache and on first call creates the cache the digestalgorithm computes a hashvalue using the javasecuritymessagedigest class with it md5algorithm and it standard provider the new computed hashvalue and the stored one are compared by the equalcomparator which return 'true' more correct a value not equal zero 1 if the value are not the same using simple string comparison a useful scenario for this selector is inside a build environment for homepage generation eg with <a href httpforrestapacheorg> apache forrest<a> &amplttarget name generateanduploadsite&ampgt &ampltecho&ampgt generate the site using forrest &ampltecho&ampgt &ampltantcall target site&ampgt &ampltecho&ampgt

&ampltftp&ampgt &amplttarget&ampgt here all <b>changed<b> file are uploaded to the server the modifiedselector save therefore much upload time this selector us reflection for setting the value of it three interface using orgapachetoolsantintrospectionhelper therefore no special 'configuration interfaces' ha to be implemented by new cache algorithm or comparators all present set xx method can be used eg the digestalgorithm can use a specified provider for computing it value for selecting this there is a setprovider string providername method so you can use a nested &ampltparam name

javasecuritymessagedigest class with it md5algorithm and it standard provider the new computed hashvalue and the stored one are compared by the equalcomparator which return 'true' more correct a value not equal zero 1 if the value are not the same using simple string comparison a useful scenario for this selector is inside a build environment for homepage generation eg with <a href

three interface using orgapachetoolsantintrospectionhelper therefore no special 'configuration interfaces' ha to be implemented by new cache algorithm or comparators all present set xx method can be

the selector you can select which file you want to have included file which are not selected are excluded with pattern you can include or exclude file based on their filename the idea is simple a given directory is recursively scanned for all file and directory each filedirectory is matched against a set of selector including special support for matching against filename with include and and exclude pattern only filesdirectories which match at least one pattern of the include pattern list or other file selector and don't match any pattern of the exclude pattern list or fail to match against a required selector will be placed in the list of filesdirectories found when no list of include pattern is supplied will be used which mean that everything will be matched when no list of exclude pattern is supplied an empty list is used such that nothing will be excluded when no selector are supplied none are applied the filename pattern matching is done a follows the name to be matched is split up in path segment a path segment is the name of a directory or file which is bounded by fileseparator '' under unix '' under window for example abcdefghixyzjava is split up in the segment abc defghi and xyzjava the same is done for the pattern against which should be matched the segment of the name and the pattern are then matched against each other when '' is used for a path segment in the pattern it match zero or more path segment of the name there is a special case regarding the use of fileseparator s at the beginning of the pattern and the string to match when a pattern start with a fileseparator the string to match must also start with a fileseparator when a pattern doe not start with a fileseparator the string to match may not start with a fileseparator when one of these rule is not obeyed the string will not match when a name path segment is matched against a pattern path segment the following special character can be used '' match zero or more character '?' match one character example class match all class filesdirs in a directory tree testa??java match all filesdirs which start with an 'a' then two more character and then java in a

specified with the selector you can select which file you want to have included file which are not selected are excluded with pattern you can include or exclude file based on their filename the idea is simple a given directory is recursively scanned for all file and directory each filedirectory is matched against a set of selector including special support for matching against filename with include and and exclude pattern only filesdirectories which match at least one pattern of the include pattern list or other file selector and don't match any pattern of the exclude pattern list or fail to match against a required selector will be placed in the list of filesdirectories found when no list of include pattern is supplied will be used which mean that everything will be matched when no list of exclude pattern is supplied an empty list is used such that nothing will be excluded when no selector are supplied none are applied the filename pattern matching is done a follows the name to be matched is split up in path segment a path segment is the name of a directory or file which is bounded by fileseparator '' under unix '' under window for example abcdefghixyzjava is split up in the segment abc defghi and xyzjava the same is done for the pattern against which should be matched the segment of the name and the pattern are then matched against each other when '' is used for a path segment in the pattern it match zero or more path segment of the name there is a special case regarding the use of fileseparator s at the beginning of the pattern and the string to match <ul> when a pattern start with a fileseparator the string to match must also start with a fileseparator when a pattern doe not start with a fileseparator the string to match may not start with a fileseparator when one of the above rule is not obeyed the string will not match <ul> when a name path segment is matched against a pattern path segment the following special character can be used '' match zero or more character '?' match one character example class match all class filesdirs in a directory tree testa??java match all filesdirs which start with an 'a' then two more character and

since ant 16 selector class that us algorithm cache and comparator for it work the algorithm is used for computing a hashvalue for a file the comparator decides whether to select or not the cache store the other value for comparison by the comparator in a persistent manner the modifiedselector is implemented a a <b>coreselector<b> and us default value for all it attribute therefore the simplest example is &ampltcopy todir dest&ampgt &ampltfilelist dir src&ampgt &ampltmodified&ampgt &ampltfilelist&ampgt &ampltcopy&ampgt the same example rewritten a coreselector with setting the all

commycompanymycache&ampgt &ampltclasspath&ampgt &ampltpathelement location libmycompanyantutiljar&ampgt &ampltclasspath&ampgt &ampltmodified&ampgt all these three example copy the file from src to dest using the modifiedselector the modifiedselector us the propertyfilecache the digestalgorithm and the equalcomparator for it work the propertyfilecache store keyvaluepairs in a simple java property file the filename is cacheproperties the update flag let the selector update the value in the cache and on first call creates the cache the digestalgorithm computes a hashvalue using the javasecuritymessagedigest class with it md5algorithm and it standard provider the new computed hashvalue and the stored one are compared by the equalcomparator which return 'true' more correct a value not equal zero 1 if the value are not the same using simple string comparison a useful scenario for this selector is inside a build environment for homepage generation eg with <a href

three interface using orgapachetoolsantintrospectionhelper therefore no special 'configuration interfaces' ha to be implemented by new cache algorithm or comparators all present set xx method can be

segment abc defghi and xyzjava the same is done for the pattern against which should be matched the segment of the name and the pattern are then matched against each other when '' is used for a path

pattern start with a fileseparator the string to match must also start with a fileseparator when a pattern doe not start with a fileseparator the string to match may not start with a fileseparator

javasecuritymessagedigest class md5algorithm standard provider new computed hashvalue stored one compared equalcomparator returns 'true' correct value equals zero 1 values using simple string comparison useful scenario selector inside build environment homepage generation eg <a href httpforrestapacheorg> apache forrest<a> &amplttarget name generateanduploadsite&ampgt &ampltecho&ampgt

set xx methods used eg digestalgorithm use specified provider computing value selecting setprovider string providername method use nested &ampltparam name algorithmprovider value myprovider&ampgt since ant 16 selector class that us algorithm cache and comparator for it work the algorithm is used for computing a hashvalue for a file the comparator decides whether to select or not the cache store the other value for comparison by the comparator in a persistent manner the modifiedselector is implemented a a <b>coreselector<b> and us default value for all it attribute therefore the simpliest example is &ampltcopy todir dest&ampgt &ampltfilelist dir src&ampgt &ampltmodified&ampgt &ampltfilelist&ampgt &ampltcopy&ampgt the same example rewritten a coreselector with setting the all

cachecachefile value cacheproperties&ampgt &ampltparam name algorithmalgorithm value md5&ampgt &ampltmodified&ampgt &ampltfilelist&ampgt &ampltcopy&ampgt and the same rewritten a customselector would

algorithmalgorithm value md5&ampgt &ampltcustom&ampgt &ampltfilelist&ampgt &ampltcopy&ampgt if you want to provide your own interface implementation you can do that via the classname attribute if the class are not on ant's core classpath you will have to provide the path via nested &ampltclasspath&ampgt element so that the selector can find the class &ampltmodified cacheclassname commycompanymycache&ampgt &ampltclasspath&ampgt &ampltpathelement location libmycomponyantutiljar&ampgt &ampltclasspath&ampgt &ampltmodified&ampgt all these three example copy the file from src to dest using the modifiedselector the modifiedselector us the propertyfilecache the digestalgorithm and the equalcomparator for it work the propertyfilecache store keyvaluepairs in a simple java property file the filename is cacheproperties the update flag let the selector update the value in the cache and on first call creates the cache the digestalgorithm computes a hashvalue using the javasecuritymessagedigest class with it md5algorithm and it standard provider the new computed hashvalue and the stored one are compared by the equalcomparator which return 'true' more correct a value not equal zero 1 if the value are not the same using simple string comparison a useful scenario for this selector is inside a build environment for homepage generation eg with <a href httpforrestapacheorg> apache forrest<a> &amplttarget name generateanduploadsite&ampgt &ampltecho&ampgt generate the site using forrest &ampltecho&ampgt &ampltantcall target site&ampgt &ampltecho&ampgt

&ampltftp&ampgt &amplttarget&ampgt here all <b>changed<b> file are uploaded to the server the modifiedselector save therefore much upload time this selector us reflection for setting the value of it three interface using orgapachetoolsantintrospectionhelper therefore no special 'configuration interfaces' ha to be implemented by new cache algorithm or comparators all present set xx method can be used eg the digestalgorithm can use a specified provider for computing it value for selecting this there is a setprovider string providername method so you can use a nested &ampltparam name algorithmprovider value myprovider&ampgt since ant 16,0
